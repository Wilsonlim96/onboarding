# Homework

## Brief

In the lesson, you are presented with 3 common mistakes and 3 mindsets needed to succeed. Perform a short reflection on  which pointers apply to you and what would you do to prepare yourself better for this program.

```
Lack of readings - I personally donâ€™t enjoy reading and thus usually skip readings if possible. But I will make it a point to spend 30min before each lesson to read and go through the pre-class work.
Ask Questions - I am an inquisitive person and likes to ask a lot of questions, and this will help me clarify doubts I have along the way and learn more efficiently
